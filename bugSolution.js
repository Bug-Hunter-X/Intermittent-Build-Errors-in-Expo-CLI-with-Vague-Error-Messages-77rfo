The solution involved carefully reviewing the third-party library's documentation and its integration with the project. In this case, there was an incompatibility between the library's version and a recently updated Expo dependency.  Updating the third-party library to its latest version resolved the intermittent build errors.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
// ... code to update the third-party library or adjust its integration ...
// Example: using npm to update the package
npm update package-name
```
If updating isn't possible, the solution might involve using a different library that provides similar functionality or rewriting the specific part of the application that uses the problematic library.
