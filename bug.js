While using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error during the build process. The error message was vague and didn't pinpoint the exact cause. I tried several troubleshooting steps, including cleaning the cache and reinstalling dependencies, but the issue persisted. The error seemed to be related to the interaction between Expo's build system and a third-party library I integrated into my project. The error was intermittent; sometimes the build would succeed, and other times it would fail with the same cryptic message.
