# Intermittent Build Errors in Expo CLI

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered while using Expo CLI for building React Native projects. The error is intermittent and provides a vague error message, making it difficult to diagnose. The issue appears to stem from an interaction with a third-party library.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Attempt to build the project using `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android`. The build may succeed or fail intermittently with a vague error message.

## Troubleshooting Steps Attempted

* Cleaning the cache (`expo prebuild --clean`)
* Reinstalling dependencies (`npm install`)
* Checking for conflicting packages
* Updating Expo CLI and related dependencies

## Potential Causes

* Conflict between Expo's build system and a third-party library
* Issues with native modules
* Underlying issues with the Expo CLI itself

## Solution

The solution involved identifying the specific third-party library causing the conflict and either updating the library, using an alternative, or modifying the integration to resolve the compatibility issues.  See bugSolution.js for a possible solution implementation.
